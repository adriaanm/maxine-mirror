/**
 * Specifies the {@linkplain #value() index} of the operand stack slot providing a parameter or

 * implicit {@code @Slot(0)} annotation applied to it to indicate that the return value
 * is pushed to the stack. As such {@code @Slot(-1)} can be used to denote that a non-void
 * template method does not push it's return value to the stack.

    /**
     * The index of the slot relative to the top of the operand stack. 0 denotes the value
     * on top of the stack. The index takes into account the fact that {@code long}
     * and {@code double} values occupy 2 slots. For example, the figure below shows
     * a stack with the annotation instance corresponding to each value on the stack:
     * <pre>
     * tos -> int        @Slot(0)
     *        long       @Slot(1)
     *        float      @Slot(3)

     *        int        @Slot(6)
     * </pre>
     * In the signature of a template method, the parameters need not follow
     * the order of the stack. The template can have extra parameters that
     * are not derived from the stack and it can ignore stack values. For example,
     * here is a template method signature that only uses two of the values from the
     * above stack and has additional non-stack-derived parameters:
     * <pre>
     *        public static void template(@Slot(4) double val1, Object obj, @Slot(0) int val2) { ... }
     * </pre>
     * A value of {@code -1} implies that the parameter or return value does not occupy
     * a stack slot.
