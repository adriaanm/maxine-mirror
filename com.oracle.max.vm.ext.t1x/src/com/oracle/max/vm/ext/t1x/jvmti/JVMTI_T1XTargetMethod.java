/**
 * Carries additional information to handle "deopt" of baseline methods that contains or will contain
 * JVMTI support code.
 *
 * There are several possible scenarios:
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li>Transforming from optimized code to non-instrumented baseline code.
 *     This should never get here as non-instrumented baseline code
 *     is compiled by the default T1X and so creates a vanilla {@link T1XTargetMethod}.</li>
 *
 * <li>Transforming from any code to baseline code containing instrumentation.
 *     In this case the deoptimization is being invoked by JVMTI in response to some new requirement,
 *     e.g., breakpoint, single step.
 *     In consequence the new code will contain embedded DIRECT_CALLs to JVMTI events, e.g. {@link JVMTIBreakpoints#event}.
 *     In which case the normal logic in {@link T1XTargetMethod#findTemplatCallReturnAddress}}
 *     will unroll to the beginning of the bytecode containing the inserted event call, causing the event
 *     to be taken immediately, or recursion if the code was already instrumented..
 *     So we have to detect that case and unroll to the "logcial" start of the bytecode, after (all) the event call(s).</li>
 * <li>
 *
 *     The "this" reference refers to the new method containing the (possibly modified) instrumentation.
 *     The {@link Deoptimization.Info#tm} field denotes the old method, allowing determination of the above states.
 * </ol>
