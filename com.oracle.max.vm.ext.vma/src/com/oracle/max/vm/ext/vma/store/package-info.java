/**
 * Everything in this subtree is related to the storing of advice-generated data using datatypes that can be stored
 * outside of the VM without any special mechanisms (e.g. object serialialization). The
 * {@link com.oracle.max.vm.ext.vma.store.VMATextStore} interface defines an essentially parallel API to
 * {@link com.oracle.max.vm.ext.vma.VMAdviceHandler} but using {@link String} and scalar data types. The majority of the
 * interface is automatically generated from {@link com.oracle.max.vm.ext.vma.VMAdviceHandler} by
 * {@link com.oracle.max.vm.ext.vma.tools.gen.VMATextStoreGenerator}, so can easily be regenerated if necessary.
 * This strategy of automatic generation is used throughout the system and the generators can be found in
 * {@code com.oracle.max.vm.ext.vma.tools.gen} subpackages.
 * <p>
 * The actual candidate handlers are in packages suffixed by {@code h}
 * to distinguish them from the support code. E.g., {@link com.oracle.max.vm.ext.vma.handlers.store.sync.h.SyncStoreVMAdviceHandler}.
 * In addition the convention is to name them using the pattern {@code NameVMAdviceHandler}.
 * <p>
 * The choice of store implementation is made by {@link com.oracle.max.vm.ext.vma.store.VMAStoreFactory} and
 * defaults to {@link com.oracle.max.vm.ext.vma.store.txt.sbps.SBPSCSFVMATextStore}, which uses a compact
 * textual representation and buffers output using a {@link java.lang.StringBuilder}, flushing periodically to a file
 * that is chosen with {@link com.oracle.max.vm.ext.vma.store.VMAStoreFile} and defaults to
 * {@value com.oracle.max.vm.ext.vma.store.VMAStoreFile#DEFAULT_STOREFILE}.
