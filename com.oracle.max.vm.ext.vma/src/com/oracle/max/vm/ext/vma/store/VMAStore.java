/**
 * Denotes a persistent store for VMA records. No implementation is prescribed, but support for per-thread stores is
 * defined here.
 *
 * The interface provides explicit support for per-thread stores through the {@code threadBatched} and {@code perThread}
 * arguments to {@link #initializeStore}. If both of these values are {@code false} then the assumption is that calls
 * from multiple threads are interleaved. If {@code threadBatched} is {@code true} then calls are batched from the same
 * thread and each batch must be preceded by a call to {@link #threadSwitch}. If {@code perThread} is {@code true} then
 * the store implementation is expected to support per-thread stores. The caller must announce new threads via the
 * {@link #newThread} method and subsequently use the returned {@VMATextStore} instance when storing
 * records for that thread. In {@code perThread} mode, the caller of {@link #initializeStore} must pass
 * a {@link PerThreadStoreOwner} and be prepared to provide the store returned from {@link #newThread} on request.
 * I.e., a store implementation is <i>not</i> required to manage the set of per-thread stores; this must be
 * supported by the store owner.
 *
 * Since the thread is implicit in per-thread or batched mode, it is permissible to pass
 * {@code null} for the {@code threadName} argument in the advice methods.
