This is as a read-only copy of the mxtool (https://hg.kenai.com/hg/maxine~mxtool).
Having a copy makes the Maxine repo more self-contained so that every revision
will always be built with a specific version of this tool, ensuring repeatability.

Changes to the tool should be made in a clone of the Kenai repo, pushed back
to Kenai and copied here.
