 * The singleton manager for instances of {@link Reference} that point (or pretend to point) at

 * <p>
 * This is a work in progress; part of an evolution toward modeling correctly the
 * generality of object representations in the VM.
 * <p>
 * A <strong>raw reference</strong> is an {@link Address} in VM memory where the object is currently
 * located.  However, the location may be subject to change by GC, so the raw reference may change over time.
 * <p>
 * References are intended to be canonical, i.e. refer to only one object.  However, in the course of inspection
 * duplicates may appear.  These are resolved at the conclusion of each GC.
