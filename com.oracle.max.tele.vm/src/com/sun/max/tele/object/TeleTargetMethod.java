/**
 * Canonical surrogate for a heap object of type {@link TargetMethod} in the VM. That object extends
 * {@link MemoryRegion}, by which it describes the area allocated for it in one of the code cache memory regions. This
 * location can change for compilations that are allocated in managed code cache regions.
 * <p>
 * The {@link TargetMethod} stores the results of a method compilation in its allocated area in the form of three arrays
 * (one or two of which may be omitted) to which the {@link TargetMethod} holds references. These arrays are represented
 * in standard object format.
 * <p>
 * When this surrogate is first created, it records, in addition to the reference to the {@link TargetMethod}, only a
 * bare minimum of information about the compiled code, mainly just its location in code cache memory. This limitation
 * keeps the overhead low, since an instance of this class is eagerly created for every compilation discovered in the
 * VM. It also avoids creating any other instances of {@link TeleObject}, which can lead to infinite regress in the
 * presence of mutually referential objects, notably with instances of {@link TeleClassMethodActor}.
 * <p>
 * The first time this object is refreshed, it gets an instance of {@link TeleClassMethodActor} that refers to the
 * {@link ClassMethodActor} in the VM that owns the compilation represented by this object.
 * <p>
 * The full contents of the compilation (including the three arrays from the code cache) are "loaded" (copied) from the
 * VM, disassembled, and cached locally only when needed. This operation is relatively expensive because a variety of
 * summary information about the compilation are derived and included in the class. The local cache is marked
 * dirty whenever an update determines that the code has been changed (e.g. patched or relocated), and only reloaded as
 * needed.
 * <p>
 * A method compilation is loaded by (restricted) deep copying the {@link TargetMethod} from the VM, and caching the
 * local instance.
 * <p>
 * Clients of target method information should operate with the single thread-safe instance of {@link MaxMachineCodeInfo}
 * provided by this object, since the information is guaranteed to represent a consistent snapshot of some version of
 * the compilation. That snapshot should not be cached by clients, however, because the compilation is subject to
 * change.
