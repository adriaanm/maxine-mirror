/**
 * <strong>Watchpoints</strong>.
 * <p>
 * A watchpoint triggers <strong>after</strong> a specified event has occurred: read, write, or exec.  So-called "before"
 * watchpoints are not supported.
 * <p>
 * Watchpoint creation may fail for platform-specific reasons, for example if watchpoints are not supported at all, or are
 * only supported in limited numbers, or only permitted in certain sizes or locations.
 * <p>
 * A new watchpoint is "alive" and remains so until removed (deleted), at which time it become permanently inert.  Any attempt
 * to enable or otherwise manipulate a removed watchpoint will cause a TeleError to be thrown.
 * <p>
 * A watchpoint is by definition "enabled" (client concept) if it is alive and one or more of the three trigger settings
 * is true:  <strong>trapOnRead</strong>, <strong>trapOnWrite</strong>, or <strong>trapOnExec</strong>.
 * If none is true, then the watchpoint is by definition "disabled" and can have no effect on VM execution.
 * <p>
 * A watchpoint is "active" (implementation concept) if it has been installed in the process running the VM, something that may
 * happen when when it is enabled.  If a watchpoint becomes disabled, it will be deactivated (removed from the process).
 * A watchpoint may also be deactivated/reactivated transparently to the client for implementation purposes.
 * <p>
 * A watchpoint with <strong>enabledDuringGC</strong> set to false will be effectively disabled during any period of time when
 * the VM is performing GC.  In practice, the watchpoint may trigger if an event takes place during GC, but execution will then
 * resume silently when it is determined that GC is underway.  This is true whether the watchpoint is relocatable or not.
 * <p>
 * A <strong>relocatable</strong> watchpoint is set on a location that is part of an object's representation.  Such a watchpoint
 * follows the object should its representation be moved during GC to a different location. The life cycle of a relocatable watchpoint
 * depends on the state of the object when first created, on the treatment of the object by the GC in the VM, and by the timing
 * in which the Inspector is able to update its state in response to GC actions.
 * <p>
 * A watchpoint may only be created on an object known to the inspector as live (neither dead nor forwarded).
 * Attempting to set a watchpoint on an object known to the inspector to be not live will cause a TeleError to be thrown.
 * <p>
 * A relocatable watchpoint associated with an object that is eventually determined to have been collected will be removed and
 * replaced with a non-relocatable watchpoint covering the same memory region.
 * <p>
 * <strong>Concurrency:</strong> operations that modify a watchpoint must necessarily be implemented by directly affecting
 * the VM processes.  Such operations fail if they are unable to acquire the VM lock held during the execution of VM commands.
