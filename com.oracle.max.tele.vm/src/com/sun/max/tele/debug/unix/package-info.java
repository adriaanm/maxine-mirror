/**
 * Common code for the Unix-specific implementations of process/thread machinery of the Inspector.
 * <p>
 * Information needed by the Inspector, critically the location of the boot heap, is garnered from
 * a {@link com.sun.max.tele.TeleVMAgent} that communicates back to the Inspector on a socket.
 * <p>
 * {@link com.sun.max.tele.debug.unix.UnixNativeTeleChannelProtocolAdaptor} reflects this by
 * extending {@link com.sun.max.tele.channel.TeleChannelProtocol} with a new {@code create} method
 * that takes the {@code TeleVMAgent} as an extra parameter.
 * <p>
 * Much of the implementation of {@link com.sun.max.tele.debug.TeleProcess} is common to
 * all the Unix implementations and is captured in {@link com.sun.max.tele.debug.unix.UnixTeleProcessAdaptor}.
 * Similarly, the access to the native methods that implement the process control is common and
 * captured in {@link com.sun.max.tele.debug.unix.UnixNativeTeleChannelProtocolAdaptor}.
