/**
 * Defines a set of native methods that must be implemented for any Maxine VM implementation to support the Inspector.
 * These derive originally from two classes in the Inspector, {@link TeleProcess} and {@link TeleNativeThread}, although
 * in the current architecture they are invoked by {@link TeleChannelProtocol}.
 *
 * These methods are not static to allow the native code to distinguish between multiple implementations that may co-exist.
 *
 * The exact interpretation of {@code processHandle} and {@code tid} in the method signatures is operating system independent,
 * but generically a  {@code processHandle} represents the process hosting the target VM and the {@code tid} denotes a thread.
 * For generality both of these are declared as {@code long}.
