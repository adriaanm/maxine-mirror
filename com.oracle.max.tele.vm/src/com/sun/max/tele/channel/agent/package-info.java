/**
 *
 * It is possible to run the Inspector on a separate machine from the target Maxine VM using
 * the code in this package. A small agent implemented by {@link com.sun.max.tele.channel.agent.InspectorAgent}
 * runs on the target machine, listening for connections from the remote Inspector process on a TCP port
 * (default value {@value com.sun.max.tele.channel.tcp.TCPTeleChannelProtocol#DEFAULT_PORT}).
 *
 * Note this package defines stub variants of {@link com.sun.max.tele.debug.TeleProcess} and
 * {@link com.sun.max.tele.debug.TeleNativeThread}. This keeps the type system happy while
 * allowing the implementation of thread gathering to work remotely..
 *
 * The generic part of the remote method communication implementation is  in {@link com.sun.max.tele.channel.agent.RemoteInvocationProtocolAdaptor}.
 * {@link com.sun.max.tele.channel.agent.AgentProtocolAdaptor} subclasses this to provide specific support for the
 * actual {@link com.sun.max.tele.channel.TeleChannelProtocol} adaptors, specifically to specify the handling of arrays, and implement the
 * interface by delegating to a specific target protocol implementation. Note that the delegated-to implementation is
 * exactly the one that is used in the non-separate configuration.
