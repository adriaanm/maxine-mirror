/**
 * Program used to debug Maxine's breakpoint implementation for methods that may
 * have been compiled by the optimizing compiler at the time the breakpoint is set.
 * Usage:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Set a breakpoint at {@link #postOpt}.</li>
 * <li>Run the program, should hit breakpoint.</li>
 * <li>Set a breakpoint at {@link #incTotal}, which should have been optimized and inlined.</li>
 * <li>Continue, should hit breakpoint at {@link #incTotal}.</li>
 * <li>Change value of {@link #done} to true and continue; program should terminate.</li>
 * </ol>
 * N.B. In the above scenario, {@code incTotal} should have been optimized
 * independently by {@code forceOptIncTotal} and then inlined into
 * {@code callIncTotal} by {@code forceOpt}.
 * Both need to be deoptimized and {@code incTotal} needs to be
 * recompiled with breakpoint support.
