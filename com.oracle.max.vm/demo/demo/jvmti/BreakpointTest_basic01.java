/**
 * Program used to debug Maxine's breakpoint implementation. Basic test 01.
 * Usage:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Set a breakpoint at {@link #foo}.</li>
 * <li>Run the program, should hit breakpoint.</li>
 * <li>Then either exit the test by continuing or step, which should step over the print.
 *     A further step should step into main, which tests that main is instrumented for
 *     single step.</li>
 * </ol>
 * N.B. In the above the breakpoint is set before {@code foo} is compiled,
 * so it is instrumented for the breakpoint on the first compilation.
