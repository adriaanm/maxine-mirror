/**
 * Program used to debug Maxine's breakpoint implementation for methods that may

 * Usage:
 * <ul>
 * <ol>Set a breakpoint at the call to {@link #spinUntilDone}.
 * <ol>Run the program, should hit breakpoint.
 * <ol>Set a breakpoint at {@link incTotal}, which should have been optimized.
 * <ol>Continue, should hit breakpoint at {@link incTotal}.
 * <ol>Change value of {@link #done} to true and continue; program should terminate.
