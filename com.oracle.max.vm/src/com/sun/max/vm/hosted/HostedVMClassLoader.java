/**
 * The VM class loader used when running in hosted mode. The singleton {@link #HOSTED_VM_CLASS_LOADER} instance is
 * identical to the singleton {@link VMClassLoader#VM_CLASS_LOADER} instance of the {@link VMClassLoader} at runtime
 * thanks to {@link JavaPrototype#hostToTarget(Object)}.
 *
 * Currently, it is not possible to extend the VM by loading classes at runtime, and if it were, we would want to
 * control the location from which such classes could originate. Therefore, the {@link VMClassLoader} is somewhat
 * similar to the <i>extensions</i> class loader and only has the boot class loader as parent. In consequence, in the
 * hosted context, we have to handle class loading of VM classes explicitly instead of just inheriting from the system
 * (application) class loader.
 *
 * Since this classloader only has the boot classloader as parent, the {{@link #findClass(String)} method will be
 * called to locate all VM classes that are either loaded explicitly via {@link #loadClass(String)} or implicitly
 * via references within a VM class loaded by this loader.
 *
 * In an simple world, the classes that construct the boot image would be completely separate from the classes from the
 * VM classes and the two sets could inhabit separate classloaders. However the existence of {@link HOSTED_ONLY} methods and
 * {@link HOSTED_ONLY} classes in the VM packages means that life is not so simple. It is possible for a hosted only
 * class to be loaded (in the system classloader) and then be referenced from a VM class that has been loaded by this
 * classloader via a {@link HOSTED_ONLY} method . Since this class does not have the system class loader as parent that
 * could lead to a duplicate instantiation of the class. That might be ok, but there is the real risk of duplication of
 * static state that should be shared. So we delegate to the system class loader in {@link #findClass}.
