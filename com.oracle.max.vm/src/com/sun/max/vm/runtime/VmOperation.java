/**
 * A VM operation that can be {@linkplain VmOperationThread#submit(VmOperation) executed}
 * on the {@linkplain VmOperationThread VM operation thread}. VM operations typically operate
 * one or more mutator threads frozen at a safepoint.
 * A thread is frozen at a safepoint when it is blocked in native
 * code (typically on an OS-level lock) and cannot (re)enter compiled/interpreted
 * Java code without being {@linkplain ThawThread thawed} by the VM operation thread.
 * Every frame of a compiled/interpreted method on a frozen thread's stack is guaranteed to be
 * at an execution point where the complete frame state of the method is available.
 * <p>
 * Freezing a thread is a co-operative action between the VM operation thread and the thread(s) being frozen.
 * There are two alternative implementations of this mechanism provided. The first uses atomic instructions
 * and the second uses memory fences. They are named "CAS" and "FENCE" and are described further below.
 * <dl>
 * <dt>CAS</dt>
 * <dd>Atomic compare-and-swap (CAS) instructions are used to enforce transitions through the following state
 * machine:
 *
 * <pre>
 *     +------+                            +--------+                                +---------+
 *     |      |--- M:JNI-Prolog{STORE} --->|        |--- VM:WaitUntilFrozen{CAS} --->|         |
 *     | JAVA |                            | NATIVE |                                | FROZEN  |
 *     |      |<--- M:JNI-Epilog{CAS} -----|        |<----- VM:ThawThread{STORE} ----|         |
 *     +------+                            +--------+                                +---------+
 * </pre>
 * The syntax for each transition operation is:
 * <pre>
 *       thread ':' code '{' update-instruction '}'
 * </pre>
 *
 * The state pertains to the mutator thread and is recorded in the
 * {@link VmThreadLocal#MUTATOR_STATE} thread local variable of the mutator thread.
 * Each transition describes which thread makes the transition ({@code M} == mutator thread, {@code VM} == VM operation
 * thread), the VM code implementing the transition ({@linkplain Snippets#nativeCallPrologue() JNI-Prolog},
 * {@linkplain Snippets#nativeCallEpilogue() JNI-Epilog}, {@linkplain WaitUntilFrozen
 * WaitUntilFrozen} and {@linkplain ThawThread ThawThread}) and the instruction used to update the state
 * variable ({@code CAS} == atomic compare-and-swap, {@code STORE} == normal memory store).</dd>
 *
 * <dt>FENCE</dt>
 * <dd>Memory fences are used to implement Dekkers algorithm to ensure that a thread is never
 * mutating during a GC. This mechanism uses both the {@link VmThreadLocal#MUTATOR_STATE} and
 * {@link VmThreadLocal#FROZEN} thread local variables of the mutator thread. The operations
 * that access these variables are in {@link Snippets#nativeCallPrologue()},
 * {@link Snippets#nativeCallEpilogue()}, {@link WaitUntilFrozen} and
 * {@link ThawThread}.
 * </dd>
 * </dl>
 * The choice of which synchronization mechanism to use is specified by the {@link #UseCASBasedThreadFreezing} variable.
 * TODO: Make the choice for this value based on the mechanism proven to runs best on each platform.
 * <p>
 * Freezing a thread requires making it enter native code. For threads already in native code, this is trivial (i.e.
 * there's nothing to do except to transition them to the frozen state). For threads executing in Java code,
 * {@linkplain Safepoint safepoints} are employed.
 * Safepoints are small polling code sequences injected by the compiler at prudently chosen execution points.
 * The effect of executing a triggered safepoint is for the thread to trap. The trap handler will then call
 * a specified {@linkplain AtSafepoint} procedure. This procedure synchronizes
 * on the global GC and thread lock. Since the VM operation thread holds this lock, a trapped thread will
 * eventually enter native code to block on the native monitor associated with the lock.
 * <p>
 * This mechanism is similar to but not exactly the same as the {@code VM_Operation} facility in HotSpot
 * except that {@link VmOperation}s can freeze a partial set of the running threads as Maxine implements
 * per-thread safepoints (HotSpot doesn't).</li>
 * <p>
 *
 * Implementation note:
 * It is simplest for a mutator thread to be blocked this way. Only under this condition can the
 * GC find every reference on a slave thread's stack.
 * If the mutator thread blocked in a spin loop instead, finding the references in the frame of
 * the spinning method is hard (what refmap would be used?). Even if the VM operation
 * is not a GC, it may want to walk the stack of the mutator thread. Doing
 * so requires the VM operation thread to be able to find the starting point for the stack walk
 * and this can only reliably be done (through use of the Java frame anchors) when the mutator
 * thread is blocked in native code.
