        // of the FOT for card C.

        // Formatting [c,e] has however several corner cases:
        // 1. [c,e] may be smaller than the minimum object size, so we can't format it.
        // Instead, we can format [x,e], such x < e and [x,e] is the min object size. In this case, FOT(C) = x - e.
        // [x,e] can only be overwritten by the last allocation from the buffer,
        // so FOT(C) doesn't need to be updated until that last allocation,
        // which is always special cased (see why below).
        // 2. s + sizeof(free chunk header) > c, i.e., the head of the free space chunk overlap C
        // Don't reformat the heap chunk. FOT(C) will be updated correctly since the allocator
        // always set the FOT table for the newly allocated cells. Since this one always
