/**
 * Per-thread log buffer with variable sized records.
 * Most space efficient but most complicated!
 * Once the circular buffer has cycled, new records can
 * partially overlap old ones, so we have to record the
 * logical "first" record id and keep it updated (for the Inspector).
 * Traversing records also requires using the arg count
 * to correctly locate the next record. An additional complication
 * is that a record might not fit in the slot at the end of the
 * buffer. We do not split records in this case but leave
 * a "hole". We mark this as "FREE" so that the Inspector
 * will skip it, and maintain the invariant that a full
 * buffer is always completely populated. (For simplicity
 * we actually leave a sequence of zero-arg holes.)
 *
 * On entry/exit, the values of firstOffset/nextOffset
 * are always {@code >= 0} and {@code < logSize}.
 * However, during the method they may exceed it, which
 * simplifies calculating the new value of firstOffset.
 *
