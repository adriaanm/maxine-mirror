/**
 * Per-thread log buffer with variable sized records. Most space efficient but most complicated! Once the circular
 * buffer has cycled, new records can partially overlap old ones, so we have to record the logical "first" record offset
 * and keep it updated. Traversing records also requires using the arg count to correctly locate the
 * next record. An additional complication is that a record might not fit in the slot at the end of the buffer. We do
 * not split records in this case but leave a "hole". We mark this as "FREE" so that scanning will skip it, and
 * maintain the invariant that a full buffer is always completely populated. (For simplicity we actually leave a
 * sequence of zero-arg holes.)
 *
 * On entry/exit to/from {@link #getRecord}, the values of {@code firstOffset/nextOffset} are always {@code >= 0} and
 * {@code < logSize}. However, during the method they may exceed it, which simplifies calculating the new value of
 * firstOffset.
 *
 * Note, as a consequence of the potential overlap of old records, a GC/flush scan cannot just start at the
 * beginning of the buffer; it must start at {@code firstOffset} to avoid encountering a partially overwritten record.
 *
 * A log with a {@link com.sun.max.vm.log.VMLog.Flusher} will only overwrite records after they have been passed to the flusher.
 * The records are all flushed at once and then the log is then reset to empty.
 *
 * This class is abstract because it does not define the specific thread locals that are used to control
 * the buffer. That is left to a concrete subclass, thereby allowing multiple instances of this log to co-exist
 * for a thread at runtime.
