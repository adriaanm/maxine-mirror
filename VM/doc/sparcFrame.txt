Execution stack frame for SPARC
-------------------------------

This document is an annex to the stackWalking.txt document. It focuses 
stack frame layout and stack walking for the SPARC architecture in
64-mode.

1. Java frames
--------------

As for AMD64, our two compilers have completely different frame
layouts. The layout of the SPARC JIT mimic closely that used by the
AMD64 and differs mostly in the choice of frame and stack pointers. 

One particularity of the JIT stack frame is that it does not use SPARC's
register windows, and operate in a single register window. 

The optimizing compiler does use registers windows follows closely the 
System V abi for SPARC of the native system.


1.1. Optimizing compiler frames

Optimizing compiler frames have a fixed size and uses both the frame
and the stack pointer. The areas of the stack frame are dictated by
the System V ABI for SPARC v9.
