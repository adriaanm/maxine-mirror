/**
 * Interface that space managers must implement to be notified of sweeping events emitted by a sweeping collector.
 * The interface allows both precise and imprecise sweeping. Precise sweeping inspects
 * every marked location to determine the end of the live data and identify every
 * dead space, and invoke the space manager for every. Imprecise sweeping only inspects marked location separated by a minimum
 * distance, thus avoiding inspecting object when the size of a potential free chunk is
 * too small to be of interest to the free space manager.
