/**
 * A space allocator that allocates both small objects and TLAB.
 * The allocator is backed with a single contiguous space and perform atomic bump pointer allocation.
 * TLAB may be allocated as a linked list of non-contiguous chunk of memory if the space left in
 * the current chunk backing the allocator is too small. In this case, the allocator delegate allocation
 * to its refill manager. The refill manager will takes the left over of the space as the first .
 *
 * The allocator may be refilled with chunks of memory of various size.
 * TLAB do not have to be allocated as a single contiguous chunk, and the space
 * requested should be treated as a hint, i.e., the returned TLAB may be slightly bigger
 * or smaller if it opportunistically reduces fragmentation of the available space.
