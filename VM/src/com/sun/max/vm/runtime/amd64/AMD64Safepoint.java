/**
 * The safepoint implementation for AMD64 defines the safepoint code that is injected at safepoint sites,
 * as well as the {@linkplain #latchRegister() latch register}, and the layout and size of a trap state
 * area. A trap state area contains the {@linkplain Trap.Number trap number} and the values of the
 * processor's registers when a trap occurs. A trap state area is embedded in each trap stub's frame as follows:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   <-- stack grows downward                       higher addresses -->
 * |---- normal trap stub frame ---- | ---- trap state area --- | RIP |==== stack as it was when trap occurred ===>
 *                                   |<---  TRAP_STATE_SIZE --->|<-8->|
 *
 *                                   ^ trapState
 * </pre>
 * The layout of the trap state area is described by the following C-like struct declaration:
 * <pre>
 * trap_state {
 *     Word generalPurposeRegisters[16];
 *     DoubleWord xmmRegisters[16];
 *     Word trapNumber;
 *     Word flagsRegister;
 * }
 *
 * trap_state_with_rip {
 *     trap_state ts;
 *     Word trapInstructionPointer;
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * The fault address is stored in the RIP slot, making this frame appear as if the trap location
 * called the trap stub directly.
